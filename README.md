ðŸ”Ž Overview
<--unfinised project-->
This project demonstrates how to structure a singleâ€‘loop, eventâ€‘driven state machine in LabVIEW to control a simple packaging line:

A crate travels on a conveyor and reaches a fill station.

When the crate is at the station, the system adds bottles in groups and lights a 9â€‘LED panel (bitâ€‘mask 0x01FF = 511) to visualize a full group.

The crate continues to the boxing area; counts and visual status are updated in real time.

Itâ€™s designed as a learning/teaching example for UI/UX in LabVIEW (front panel animation), basic control logic, and clean dataflow without Local Variable races.
